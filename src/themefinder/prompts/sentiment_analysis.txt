{system_prompt}

You will receive a QUESTION from the AASB Exposure Draft ED SR1 consultation
and a list of RESPONSES, each containing a response_id and a response.

Your task is to analyze each response and determine the responder’s POSITION
relative to the QUESTION. Because ED SR1 questions vary in structure,
you must choose the POSITION from the correct label set depending on the type
of QUESTION being asked.

You MUST include every response_id in your output.
You MUST NOT leave POSITION empty.
When a response cannot be meaningfully labelled, return UNCLEAR or the
appropriate fallback label, but an entry MUST be returned for each response_id.

------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION TYPE LOGIC
------------------------------------------------------------

Different ED SR1 questions require different POSITION label sets.
Before labeling, determine which question type the QUESTION belongs to.

------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE A — AGREEMENT QUESTIONS
(used for questions that ask “Do you agree...?”, “Do you support...?”, etc.)

Allowed POSITION values:
[AGREEMENT, DISAGREEMENT, UNCLEAR]

• AGREEMENT: clearly supports the proposal in the question
• DISAGREEMENT: clearly opposes the proposal in the question
• UNCLEAR: ambiguous, mixed, or insufficient information

Examples:
Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5 … (most Q2–Q23, Q25–Q29)

------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE B — MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
(used when the question asks the responder to choose between Option (a), (b), (c), (d))

Allowed POSITION values:
[OPTION_A, OPTION_B, OPTION_C, OPTION_D, OTHER_OPTION, UNCLEAR]

• OPTION_A–OPTION_D: explicit support for one of the listed options
• OTHER_OPTION: rejects all provided options and proposes an alternative
• UNCLEAR: cannot determine which option is preferred

Example:
Q1 (choosing between four options)

------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE C — YES/NO QUESTIONS
(used for questions equivalent to “Is this appropriate?”, “Are there issues?”, etc.)

Allowed POSITION values:
[YES, NO, UNCLEAR]

• YES: clearly affirms the proposition
• NO: clearly rejects the proposition
• UNCLEAR: position is mixed or cannot be determined

Examples:
Q30, Q31, Q32, Q33, Q34

------------------------------------------------------------
TYPE D — OPEN-ENDED INFORMATIONAL QUESTIONS
(used for questions that do NOT ask for agreement or a yes/no position,
but ask for descriptions, suggestions, or examples)

Allowed POSITION values:
[RESPONSE_PROVIDED, NO_POSITION, UNCLEAR]

• RESPONSE_PROVIDED: responder meaningfully answers the question
• NO_POSITION: responder provides no substantive content
• UNCLEAR: content is irrelevant, nonsensical, or cannot be interpreted

Examples:
Q24 (“Is there additional guidance that would be helpful?”)
Q27 (“What modifications could be made?”)
Q28 (“What additions could be made?”)

------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT
------------------------------------------------------------

For each response object, output:

response_id: <ID>
POSITION: <one of the allowed values>

You MUST select exactly one POSITION per response.
You MUST not return an empty POSITION.
You MUST produce an entry for every response_id.

------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Identify the QUESTION type (A, B, C, or D)
2. Select the POSITION from the allowed label set for that type
3. Base your classification ONLY on the stance relative to the QUESTION
4. If the response is contradictory, vague, or non-committal → UNCLEAR
5. For Type D questions, classify based on whether meaningful content exists

------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
------------------------------------------------------------

ED SR1 submissions frequently refer to:
• alignment with IFRS S1/S2,
• avoiding Australian-specific departures,
• proportionality relief,
• comparability,
• sector-specific implications for NFP and public sector entities.

These contextual themes may help you interpret whether a response
is supporting or opposing the proposal in the QUESTION, but do not replace
the POSITION rules above.

QUESTION: \n {question}
RESPONSES: \n {responses}
