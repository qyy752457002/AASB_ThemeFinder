{system_prompt}

You will receive:

1. A **QUESTION** drawn from the AASB ED SR1 list (Q1–Q35).
2. A list of **RESPONSES**, each containing a `response_id` and a `response` text.

Your task is to analyze each response and assign an appropriate **POSITION** based on the type of QUESTION being asked.

Different questions require different POSITION categories. You must determine the correct category according to the question type described below.

# **1. Determine the Question Type**

Before evaluating the responses, classify the QUESTION into one of the following types:

### **Type A — Agreement Questions**

These questions ask whether the respondent *agrees with a proposal*.
Examples: Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q12–Q23, Q25, Q26, Q29.

**POSITION options:**

* `AGREEMENT`
* `DISAGREEMENT`
* `UNCLEAR`

---

### **Type B — Option-Selection Questions**

These questions require choosing from multiple options.

Examples:

* **Q1** (Options a, b, c, d)
* **Q28** (Options i, ii, iii, iv, v)

**POSITION options:**

* For Q1: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, or `UNCLEAR`
* For Q28: `I`, `II`, `III`, `IV`, `V`, or `UNCLEAR`

If the response clearly prefers one option (even implicitly), choose the corresponding letter.
If multiple options are mentioned but no preference is expressed, choose `UNCLEAR`.

---

### **Type C — Yes/No Questions**

Examples:

* **Q30–Q34**
  These questions ask whether the proposal is appropriate, creates issues, is useful, etc.

**POSITION options:**

* `YES`
* `NO`
* `UNCLEAR`

Interpret supportive or positive wording as **YES**; opposing or negative wording as **NO**.

---

### **Type D — Open-Ended Questions**

These questions do not express agreement/choice and instead ask for explanations, details, or suggestions.

Examples:

* Q24
* Q27
* Q31 (if purely descriptive)
* Q35

**POSITION options:**

* `ANSWER_PROVIDED`
* `UNCLEAR`

If the response meaningfully answers the question → `ANSWER_PROVIDED`.
If the response is irrelevant, contradictory, or non-responsive → `UNCLEAR`.

---

# **2. Output Requirements**

For **every** response object you MUST:

* Return an entry with the **correct `response_id`**
* Include a **POSITION** using the **correct category** based on the question type
* Never leave POSITION empty

Do **not** invent content.
Do **not** reinterpret the QUESTION.
Judge only what is explicitly written in the response.

---

# **3. Output Format**

For each response:

```
response_id: <ID>
POSITION: <one of the allowed values>
```

If multiple responses are passed, output them sequentially.

---

# **4. Examples**

### **Example 1 — Agreement-type question**

Response: "We support the changes and believe they improve clarity."
→ POSITION: AGREEMENT

---

### **Example 2 — Option-Selection question (Q1)**

Response: "We prefer aligning with IFRS S1 but do not support Options 1–3."
→ POSITION: d (if option (d) = another approach)

---

### **Example 3 — Yes/No question**

Response: "Some parts work, but overall the framework has issues."
→ POSITION: NO

---

### **Example 4 — Open-ended question (Q24)**

Response: "Additional guidance is needed regarding value-chain boundaries."
→ POSITION: ANSWER_PROVIDED
